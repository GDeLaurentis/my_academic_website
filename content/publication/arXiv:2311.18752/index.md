abstract: "We complete the computation of two-loop helicity amplitudes required to obtain next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections for three-jet production at hadron colliders, including all contributions beyond the leading-color approximation. The analytic expressions are reconstructed from finite-field samples obtained with the numerical unitarity method. We find that the reconstruction is significantly facilitated by exploiting the overlaps between rational coefficient functions of quark and gluon processes, and we display their compact generating sets in the appendix of the paper. We implement our results in a public code, and demonstrate its suitability for phenomenological applications."
