abstract: "We compute the two-loop helicity amplitudes for the scattering of five gluons, including all contributions beyond the leading-color approximation. The analytic expressions are represented as linear combinations of transcendental functions with rational coefficients, which we reconstruct from finite-field samples obtained with the numerical unitarity method. Guided by the requirement of removing unphysical singularities, we find a remarkably compact generating set of rational coefficients, which we are able to display entirely in the manuscript. We implement our results in a public code, which provides efficient and reliable numerical evaluations for phenomenological applications."
