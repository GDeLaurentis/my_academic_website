*Abstract*

Recently there has been significant progress in understanding the
Regge limit in massless scattering amplitudes. In particular, all
the ingredients needed for the computation of the BFKL kernel at
NNLO have been determined in QCD, apart from the two-gluon
central emission vertex at one loop, which is known so far only
in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We present the
calculation of the next-to-multi-Regge-kinematic (NRMK) limit of
the six-gluon amplitude in QCD, from which this vertex can be
determined. Due to the complexity of the expressions for the
next-to-maximally-helicity-violating (NMHV) amplitude and the
high powers of spurious poles in the NMRK expansion parameter, we
use p-adic evaluation to obtain numerical samples for the leading
NMRK behaviour. We then employ analytic reconstruction techniques
to recover analytic results in a minimal set of independent
variables. In particular, allowed partial fraction depositions
are identified through nested p-adic limits near codimension-two
varieties.
